# MiddleClick without menubar icon

Emulate a middleclick with triple tap on MacBook trackpad and Magic Mouse. Use private osx api for using the [macbook multitouch trackpad code](http://www.steike.com/code/multitouch/) and some [middleclick code](http://www.r0ssar00.com/2008/12/middle-click-on-mac-code.html).
